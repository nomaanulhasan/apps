# Apps: My Code Playground

Welcome to the Apps repository! This subdomain is part of my personal portfolio web-app, dedicated to hosting all of my learning and practice projects. Here, you'll find a collection of various applications that I have developed to enhance my skills and showcase my work.

## Purpose

The Apps repository serves as a platform for me to explore different programming concepts, experiment with new technologies, and gain hands-on experience in developing real-world applications. Each project within this repository represents a unique learning journey and highlights specific web development skills or technologies that I have acquired during the development process.

## Contents

The repository includes a range of applications covering different aspects of web development. Here are some of the skills and technologies featured in these projects:

- Front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Frameworks and libraries like React, Redux, Next.js, and TypeScript.
- Styling with Tailwind CSS, SCSS, Material-UI, Bootstrap, and other CSS frameworks.
- Back-end development with Node.js and Express.js OR Next.js.
- Full-stack application development, integrating front-end and back-end components.
- Canvas-based applications using Fabric.js for interactive graphics and design.
- 3D work using Spline and Three.js.
- Other technologies and tools commonly used in web development.

Each project is contained within its own directory, along with relevant documentation, source code, and any necessary dependencies.
